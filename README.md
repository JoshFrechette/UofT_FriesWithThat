# Overview

* Fries With That?! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app displays the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

* The app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

# User Directions

- The user types their choice of burger in the textbox, then presses the "submit" button.
- After pressing the submit button, the inputted burger choice appears on the left with a "devour" button appearing beside it.
- After the "devour" button is pressed, the burger choice tranfers from the left side of the screen to an area on the right.

All burger choices will be logged into a database in the backend.
